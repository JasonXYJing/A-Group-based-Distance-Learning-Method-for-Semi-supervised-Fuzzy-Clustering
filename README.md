1, The selection of constraints is based on Constraints Library in Metric_learn Library.

2, The format of must_index/cannot_index is a list, e.g. must_index is [[2,3], [4,5]] represents must_link pair (2,3) and (4,5), where 2,3,4,5 are the locations of data points.

3, The format of must_link/cannot_link is a list, e.g, must_link is [[[0.68035305, 0.42251781], [0.19510138, 0.89455886]], where the numeric values are feature values of data points.
